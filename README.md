## Overview

### The challenge

To build out a Social Media Dashboard and get it looking as close to the design as possible. The designs for this project are in th '/design' directory and include mobile and desktop versions of the layout design. As they are in .jpg format, I will have to use my best judgement with regards to styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`.

***Users should be able to***:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Toggle color theme to their preference

### Useful resources

#### Accessibility

- [Accessibility Developer Guide](https://www.accessibility-developer-guide.com/) - There are a lot of great articles and code examples that explore the best practices to ensure your website is structured in a way that is accessible to everyone and plays more nicely with assistive technologies. 
- [ADG: Hiding Elements Visually by Moving them Off-screen](https://www.accessibility-developer-guide.com/examples/hiding-elements/visually/) - I knew there would need to be some screen-reader only text for card titles/usernames, so that users can tell contextually that it's a twitter handle or number of FaceBook likes etc. This article helped me find an appropriate solution to the problem.
